# Object-Size-Measurement

This project is based on Object Detection using Python Libraries (mainly OpenCV). In the project, we will be capturing a live image using a camera and the Python code will produce 
an image with the measurements of the objects present in that image.


# Libraries used - 
1. scipy.spatial.distance - For measuring the euclidean distance
2. imutils - For perspective and Contours
3. numpy
4. cv2


# Authors-
This project is a collaborative work of Shaira Lapus from Phillipines and Runjhun Ratawal from India.
